# Types: 
#   Binary Tree - Each node has <= 2 childern
#   Binary Search Tree (BST) - left < node < right
#   Balanced Tree - Height is controlled
#   Complete Tree - Filled left to right 
#   Full Tree - Each node has 0 or 2 childern 

# Traversal:
#   DFS(Depth First):
#       Preorder(Root,left,right)
#       Inorder(left,root,right)
#       Postorder(left,right,root)
#   BFS(Level Order):
#       Use a queue
#
